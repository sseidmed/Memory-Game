This game works like your typical memory game, where you flip two cards and if they match, they stay open. However, if they don't, then they close. Upon completion you get a pop-up modal, stating your time, number of moves, and number of stars you earned. If you get less than 15 moves, you should get 3 stars, if your moves are more than 15 and less than 25, you get 2 stars, and lastly, if your moves are more than 25, then you get a single star.

One thing I couldn't get to properly work was the timer when my pop-up window stays open. Once the game is over, timer stops, but it immediately starts back up again.
